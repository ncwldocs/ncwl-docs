**Comrade,**

Congratulations on your successful conscription and reactivation under Directive 88-R, Subsection 12. You are now in active service of the People's Union Homeguard. In accordance with standard cryogenic deployment procedures, minor cognitive disruption referred to as Cryogenic Memory Suppression Syndrome (CMSS) is a documented and anticipated side effect. The Ministry is aware of your condition. You will adapt. You are expected to serve.

You have been assigned to the **Taypan Forward Operational Theater** in direct support of the Liberation Campaign and stabilization of **Outpost and Port Authority Zones**. The loss of these strategic holdings would result in operational regression exceeding 3–5 years. Therefore, **maintenance, security, and expansion of the Sector are of highest  priority.**

Stitched together from the still-warm corpses of many labor unions that were in disorganized rebellion against Imperial forces in the Feudal Era before the collapse of Bluespace lanes leading in and out of the Sector, the NCWL are the undisputed victors of the Crescent Revolution, holding four out of six systems within the Sector and ruling from their seat of power in the Core. Holding socialist ideals at heart, the NCWL aims to build a government by laborers, and for the people. Recently having launched a liberation campaign against the Taypan system in the Outer Rim, the League threw their hats in for the untamed frontier - and failed. Remnant militias still roam the system, however, despite the loss of support from Chengridz.

Of all factions in Taypan, only the NCWL could be called a truly progressive force. Aiming for the emancipation of workers from the domination of noble and corporate elites, they are also the only explicitly xenophilic power in the area, garnering much support from non-humans inhabiting the frontier. That does not, however, mean that the League's military methods are completely innocent: scorched earth tactics, campaigns targeting civilian commerce, as well as a reliance on conscription and forced mobilization puts them in an unenviable moral situation. Still, many would argue they are the best hope for Sector Crescent, which explains the numerous resistance cells that dot Imperial planets and aerospace.
