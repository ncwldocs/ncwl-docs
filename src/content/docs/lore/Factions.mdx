## Faction Summaries

### New Crescent Worker's League

A revolutionary front of militias, labor unions, and insurgent cells. The NCWL was born from a popular revolt among plasma extraction workers in the Imperial frontier and has since waged an interminable war against the Divine Sol Mandate in Taypan.


### Divine Sol Mandate

A neo-feudalist empire of aristocratic slavers, united in their quasi-religious cult of personality around "Kaiser" Reynald Guies. Installed as a military dictatorship during humanity's earliest days of interstellar travel, the DSM has held much of the known galaxy under its oppressive heel for the past 200 years.


### Taypan Free Stations Coalition

Ostensibly a collection of commercial interests, private security forces, and assorted contractors representing the local inhabitants of Taypan. In practice, the Coalition is a barely-disguised front for criminal gangs and petty warlords.
