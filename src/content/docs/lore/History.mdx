## NCWL History

In 101 BBSC (Before Bluespace Collapse), the Crescent United Worker's Front is formed to demand humane treatment for plasma extractors laboring in servitude to the Divine Sol Mandate. After diplomatic attempts fail, a decades-long rebellion ensues, with various worker's militias uniting as the New Crescent Worker's League.

The Battle for Chengridz (81-78 BBSC) culminates in the NCWL seizing the sector's largest stores of plasma as well as the warp-gates leading in and out of the system. Communard forces secure further victories in the decades to come. As word of the rebellion reaches the Imperial core worlds, the Mandate severs the stargate lanes connecting Taypan to the rest of the galaxy. This becomes known as the **Great Bluespace Collapse**.

Skirmishes with Imperial remnants convince NCWL leadership to commission Nova Belraska, a habitable station and base of operations for the NCWL Homeguard; construction is completed in 55 ABSC (After Bluespace Collapse). By 68 ABSC, the Imperial insurgency manages to detonate a nuclear explosive onboard the station. The surviving communards are forced to regroup aboard the Dear Clementine, a bulk cargo freighter converted into a battlecruiser. An abandoned corporate outpost is eventually fashioned into a temporary headquarters and deemed **Port Vladzena**.
