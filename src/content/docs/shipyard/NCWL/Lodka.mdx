> *A combat freighter developed originally in Chengridz and soaring in popularity in the frontier system of Taypan; the Lodka has an ample cargo hold and enough armaments to deter small pirate gangs from approaching. She sees little use in frontline wars, but can occasionally be seen escorting larger vessels as both logistics and fire support.*
