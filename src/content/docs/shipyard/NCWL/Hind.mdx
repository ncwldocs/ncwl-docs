> *A civilian exploration frigate converted into a nimble missile carrier. The Hind boasts heavy manoeuvring thrusters and robust, all-rounding point defense coverage. Armed with the Gargoyle cruise missile platform as its primary weapon, a well-defended Hind is perfectly capable of raining hell on targets from the backline.*
