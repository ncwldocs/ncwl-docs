> *An anti-fighter variant of the Broadsword. Lighter, more nimble, but considerably more fragile than it's ultralight bomber cousin. Excellent longevity in it's ability to lay down suppressing fire, but suffers against anything larger than it's own weight class.*


## Armaments

* Fixed
  * 2x <ShipWeapon weaponID="NTVulcanTurret" />


## Notes

Primarily useful against other ultralights or very lightly-armed ships. Low survivability.
