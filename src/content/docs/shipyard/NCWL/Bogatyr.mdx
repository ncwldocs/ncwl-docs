> *An outdated Imperial scouting gunship converted into a stealth bomber - the Bogatyr invests heavily into ballistics; with two SHI slugthrowers and missile racks. Implemented with a fortified 'combat' mode and radio jammer, the Bogatyr sees frequent use in many communard naval operations today.*

## Notes

Use the slugthrowers to weaken enemy ships before following up with missiles to completely disable or destroy them. Load EMP munitions into at least one missile rack in order to immobilize your targets. You may benefit from a dedicated loader but the Bogatyr is capable of solo operation.

The Bogatyr's radio jammer is capable of disabling all radio communications within 500m (including your own).
