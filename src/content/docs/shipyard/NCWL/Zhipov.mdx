> *A converted capital freighter, the Zhipov stands a testament to collective, organized desperation. An Imperial freighter is captured, the container gravlocks and internal cargo bays are stripped out, and a microforge capable of printing ultralight strikeshuttles are installed within the vessel, alongside docking ports to accompany them. Wire warship-grade auto-guided turrets onto the broadsides, and the end result is the Zhipov.*
