> *A glass coffin to die in. The Rapier-class is a cored-out mining drone originally rated for firing depth charges into large chunks of asteroid rock, later repurposed into a penal torpedo bomber to stuff misbehaving pilots into. It'll kill. Whether you survive after is another matter.*


## Armaments

* Fixed
    * 2x <ShipWeapon weaponID="ShuttleGunTorpedo" />


## Notes

Should be used only for bombing runs against large or slow-moving targets. No defensive capabilities against other ultralights. Escort it with a fighter or keep it very close to its carrier.
