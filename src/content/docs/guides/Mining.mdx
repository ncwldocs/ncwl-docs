Mining provides the necessary resources for our struggle against the imperialist powers. With some preparation, you will return from your trip to the asteroids both alive and prosperous.

## How To

1. Acquire a vessel with mining weaponry and ore magnet (such as the [Exhumer](../../shipyard/civilian/exhumer) or [Gazpachov](../../shipyard/civilian/gazpachov)). *Mining by hand is not recommended due to the increased time required and decreased awareness of surroundings.*

2. If possible, bring at least one armed escort ship (such as the [Vanguard](../../shipyard/ncwl/vanguard)) to deter piracy. If no escort is available, proceed with caution.

3. Fly to the nearest marked asteroid field or whichever field is devoid of hostile or competing forces.

4. Mine asteroids using your ship's weaponry and collect the ore. Do not process the ore on your ship; return to base and use the advanced ore processor there.

5. Stay aware of hostile movements on your ship's MAP screen as well as unidentified craft on the NAV screen or radar. If unknown or hostile craft appear, it's best to flee immediately back to base. **Fleeing to return with less ore is better than not returning at all.**
