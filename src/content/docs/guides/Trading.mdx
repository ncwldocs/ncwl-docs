Various trade goods can be purchased at a station's **Dispensary** or **Commissary** (or manufactured using various **Commodity Fabricators**) and then sold for a profit at other stations. Each station has a unique list of trade goods that can be purchased or produced from materials â€“ some easier to come by than others. Available trading partners vary depending on the NCWL's relationship with other factions.

The value of trade goods tends to increase the farther you travel from their point of origin. Goods hauled to a distant station will typically sell for more than goods hauled to a nearby station.

## How-To

1. Find a **Dispensary**, **Station Commissary**, or **Commodity Fabricator** on a station, typically in cargo- or industry-related areas. You can view the material or monetary costs of available trade goods at these machines. Commodity Fabricators may be called something else (such as "scrap upcycler") depending on the type of goods produced.

2. If crafting goods using a Commodity Fabricator, gather necessary **materials** via mining, salvage, or botany. If purchasing goods from a Dispensary or Commissary, money will be deducted directly from your bank account.

3. Print as many **crates** as desired and load them into any ship large enough to transport them.

4. Bring the creates to a different station with a **Turn-in Chute**. At the Turn-in Chute, insert the crate (click the chute using the same hand dragging the crate) and it will dispense a **deed**.

5. Insert the deeds into a **Deed Console** to receive a credit chip. This should be done at an NCWL station, as the station's faction receives a small amount of money from each deed as an incentive to promote trading. Deposit your credit chips at an ATM.
