## Gameplay

Gameplay in Hullrot diverges from that of most other Space Station 14 servers in several ways:

- **Most players are members of various warrings factions.** If you're in a faction (including the NCWL), you'll benefit from coordinating your activities with others and accepting some guidance from leaders.

- **You may kill and be killed by hostile factions.** Roleplay is encouraged, but hostile faction members can be killed on sight without escalating levels of conflict. The possibility of imminent combat and death should be expected. *If you're not sure which factions are currently hostile to your own, ask someone in your faction.*

- **Gameplay is ship-focused.** You may need to maintain and protect your faction's base of operations, but ships are your primary means of interacting with the world.

### Earning Money and Resources

There are several ways to contribute to your faction's success or increase your personal wealth.

#### Mining

Visit one of Taypan's asteroid fields and collect ores. Use a purpose-built mining ship or dig through the asteroid with hand tools. Transform refined ores into weapons, ammunition, ships, or other valuable items.

#### Techmining

Search floating chunks of debris for research data disks that can unlock new technologies for your faction (or your personal techmining shuttle).

#### Trading

Haul crates from station to station for a big payout. See [Trading](../trading/).

#### Salaries

If you belong to a faction, they likely have a console that slowly generates money; for example, the NCWL receives funding from its headquarters at regular intervals. Each faction organizes itself differently, but there should be some system for receiving pay for your service.
