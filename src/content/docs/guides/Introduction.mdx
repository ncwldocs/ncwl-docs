## Orientation 

### Communications Equipment

Verify functionality of all standard-issue Homeguard communication devices. Union frequencies begin with identifier: `O:`

Upon activation, you are to immediately broadcast your **rank and presence** over secure channels.

### Rearmament

Proceed to the nearest **Union Armory**. The Ministry forbids hoarding; all gear is **communal property of the Homeguard**. Standard loadout recommendations are as follows:

* 1x **MK-2 Falin** rifle (or other primary weapon)
* 2â€“3x rifle magazines
* 2x sidearm magazines (optional but advised)
* 1x tourniquet and/or bandage kit


### Coordination

You are to report to the nearest **Briefing Site**, commonly located in cargo bays or auxiliary command halls. If such a site is not active, report the failure of protocol to the **Rear Observation Post** via encrypted channel. Lapses in coordination are logged and penalized.


### Ranking Structure

In order from lowest to highest rank:

* **Citizen-Soldat** 
* **Partizan**
* **Unionkapitan**
* **Kommissar**
* **Admiral** 

> *There are no "Majors" operating within this theater. Any individual claiming such title should be reported immediately for investigation under Internal Directive 77-K.*


## Duty Assignments

Your service will consist of one or more of the following duties, assigned dynamically based on operational demand.

* **Logistics Operations**: Piloting cargo vessels or escorting hauls between asteroid belts, derelict yards, and resource points.
* **Asset Production**: Manufacturing munitions, field equipment, and mechanical parts. Includes the repair and retrofitting of Union vessels.
* **Port Patrol**: Maintaining airspace dominance, identifying foreign incursion attempts, and suppressing pirate or imperialist activity. This is the most common assignment; expect frequent deployment.
* **Port Security & Maintenance**: Guarding vital infrastructure, overseeing civilian activity, and ensuring perimeter integrity. Irregularities must be reported, not ignored.

Take note of the following:

* All actions must be performed as part of an authorized Squad or Flight Group.

* Unsanctioned, individual operations are a breach of protocol.

* A Communard shall fight, work, and dine with their comrades.

Failure to adhere to any section of this order will be documented, reviewed, and escalated as necessary.

Remember: you do not fight only for yourself. You fight for the Union. The revolution feeds those who serve it.

**FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR THE UNION. FOR THE LEAGUE.**
